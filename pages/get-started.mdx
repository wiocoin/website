# Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/wiocoin-project/wiocoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Wiocoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wiocoin-dev)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #wiocoin-dev.
